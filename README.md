# Employee Information
This program is designed to take user input (By calling and storing data in Mutators) about employees and generate a report at the end (By calling on Accessors).

## Future goals for this project
- remove the hard coding of 3 employees and convert to a for-loop
- change said for loop into its own meathod(s)
